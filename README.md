# Skills for Digital Research Alliance

This skill teaches Claude Code and/or Codex about our Slurm clusters, storage rules,
login-node safety, experiment conventions, and reusable HPC workflows.

## Recommended Setup

### Run the tool you want to use at least once

- Claude Code: run `claude` and log in with `/login`
- Codex: run `codex` and log in

### Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medfm-flare/DRA-skills ~/DRA-config
```

### Open Claude Code or Codex and say:

```text
Read ~/DRA-config/README.md and install the lab config for me.
Configure Claude Code, Codex, or both depending on what is available.
```

The assistant should inspect this repo, detect the Alliance cluster (e.g. Fir), write saved setup values, and run `setup.sh`.

## Manual Setup

Use this if you want to run the installer yourself:

```bash
cd ~/DRA-config

# Claude Code only (default)
./setup.sh --modules fir --targets claude

# Codex only
./setup.sh --modules fir --targets codex

# Both
./setup.sh --modules fir --targets codex,claude
```

If you are on a cluster login node, `setup.sh` can usually auto-detect modules. Use `--modules` when you want to be
explicit.

## What Gets Installed

| Target      | Installed config                                                    | Reusable workflows                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, generated `settings.json`, statusline, hooks | `~/.claude/skills/*`, `~/.claude/agents/*` |
| Codex       | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`                                                | `~/.codex/skills/*`                        |

Shared workflows include:

- `ccdb-clusters` - Alliance-wide cluster mechanics, storage, billing, Python install guidance, and fair-share helper scripts.
- `onboard` - interactive setup helper.
- `slurm-status` - check GPU/resource availability.
- `slurm-job` - create or modify sbatch scripts.
- `slurm-seff-report` - retrofit a job script to emit an inline cgroup CPU/memory snapshot; final `seff` after job exit remains authoritative.
- `slurm-debug` - diagnose failed, killed, or pending jobs.
- `submit-experiment` - submit documented Slurm experiments.
- `harvest` - collect completed experiment results.
- `connect` - establish/verify key-based SSH access to the cluster (one-time key upload done by `onboard`).
- `slurm-queue`, `slurm-resource`, `slurm-storage` - Claude agents converted into Codex skills where needed.

Claude supports hooks/statusline directly. Codex does not, so login-node safety and tool usage rules are injected into
`AGENTS.md` instead.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/DRA-config
git pull
./setup.sh --targets <same-targets-you-installed>
```

For example, use `--targets claude` for Claude Code only, `--targets codex` for Codex only, or `--targets claude,codex`
if both tools are initialized. Or ask Claude Code/Codex to read this README and update the lab config for you.

## Uninstalling

```bash
cd ~/DRA-config
./uninstall.sh
```

This removes repo-owned symlinks and strips the managed lab block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
Personal content outside the markers is preserved. Backups are kept under `~/.claude/backups/` and `~/.codex/backups/`.

## Source Layout

The repo uses a core-plus-adapter design:

```text
shared/instructions/core.md      # Lab facts shared by Claude Code and Codex
shared/instructions/claude.md    # Claude-specific commands, hooks, agents
shared/instructions/codex.md     # Codex-specific AGENTS.md and skill guidance

modules/<cluster>/instructions/core.md
modules/<cluster>/instructions/claude.md
modules/<cluster>/instructions/codex.md

shared/skills/                   # Shared skills
shared/codex/skills/             # Codex-only skill adapters
shared/agents/                   # Claude agents, converted to Codex skills
shared/hooks/                    # Claude-only hooks
shared/settings.json             # Claude-only settings template
```

Why this shape:

- Shared cluster/storage policy lives once, so Claude and Codex do not drift.
- Tool-specific behavior stays in small adapter files.
- The installer is slightly more compositional, but future tools can be added without duplicating all lab policy.

## Skill Authoring

Skills in this repo follow the Agent Skills conventions below. Apply them when adding or editing a
skill (most map directly to the issues this bundle was hardened against):

- **Progressive disclosure.** Keep `SKILL.md` lean — only the key path. The `name` + `description`
  (~100 words) is always in context; the body loads when the skill triggers; put heavy reference
  material (tables, long examples) in `references/` and executable logic in `scripts/`. Reference
  bundled scripts via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/...`, never relative paths.
- **`description` = what + when.** Third person, stating both what the skill does and the trigger
  conditions/keywords a user would say. Claude tends to *under*-trigger — be explicit about when
  to use it.
- **Single responsibility.** One skill, one job; keep the body well under 500 lines (split if it
  grows). Prefer several small skills over one giant one.
- **`allowed-tools` matches the body.** Grant exactly the commands the skill runs, in space-pattern
  syntax (`Bash(sbatch *)`, not `Bash(sbatch:*)`); no over-broad grants.
- **Single source of truth, not prose.** State-tracking workflows (e.g. `submit-experiment`,
  `harvest`) keep a structured file (`metadata.yaml`) as the SSOT and derive human-readable views
  from it — never parse markdown for state.
- **Fail loud.** Helper scripts exit non-zero with a clear message on real errors; never emit
  empty/partial output that silently breaks a downstream command.
- **Test before shipping.** Validate a new or changed skill in a fresh session (ideally via a
  subagent) against a couple of realistic prompts before relying on it.

## Contributing

Common changes:

- New cluster: add `modules/<name>/instructions/core.md`, optional `claude.md` / `codex.md`, and optional skill
  templates.
- New reusable workflow: add it under `shared/skills/`.
- Claude-only automation: use `shared/hooks/`, `shared/agents/`, or `shared/settings.json`.
- Codex-only adaptation: use `shared/codex/`.

Keep durable lab facts in `core.md`; keep tool syntax in the adapter files.
