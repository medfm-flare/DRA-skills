# Fir SSH Setup & Reuse — Full Reference

Bundled reference for the `onboard` (one-time setup) and `connect` (per-session reuse) skills.
Read this when the lean steps in those skills aren't enough: an existing key in an odd format,
an encrypted (passphrase) key, a Windows host, agent-driven login, or a connection failure.

## Why you can't log in one-shot (agent has no tty)

Logging in to Fir needs two interactive things an agent handles worst:

1. **The private-key passphrase** — most keys are encrypted and need a password to unlock.
2. **Duo 2FA** — an interactive menu, then the user must **approve a push on their phone**.

An agent's shell usually has **no tty and no system `ssh-askpass`**, so it cannot type the
passphrase or Duo choice unaided. You'll see
`ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory`. DRA-config includes a narrow
Windows helper that can select Duo Push; the user still approves the push on their own device.

**Key fact for Fir:** a registered public key is only **factor 1**. Even when the server accepts
the key (`Authenticated using "publickey" with partial success`), Fir still requires **factor 2**
(`keyboard-interactive` = Duo). A registered key does **not** give passwordless login. The only way
to get passwordless *reuse* on supported platforms is **ControlMaster**: the user completes the 2FA
login **once** interactively, the socket persists (`ControlPersist`), and the agent reuses it. When
Windows multiplexing is unavailable or unreliable, each new connection requires Duo; the bundled
helper only selects Duo Push and never approves it.

| | Mode A: user logs in | Mode B: agent-driven login |
|---|---|---|
| Who types the passphrase | The user | The user unlocks the key in their own SSH agent; no passphrase is supplied to the assistant |
| Who approves Duo | The user (phone) | The user (phone) |
| Security | High — password never touches the agent | No secret crosses the session; a locked key requires Mode A |
| When to use | Safe fallback when askpass is unavailable or the key is locked | **DRA-config default for the Claude `connect` flow** via `warm-socket.sh` |

The Windows/Codex fallback below is a separate, passphrase-free askpass path: it returns an empty
response for key passphrases and only selects a recognized Duo Push option.

**Hard rules:** keep passphrases out of chat and assistant-created scripts;
the Duo factor is **always** approved by the user on their own device — never try to bypass it; only
ever do this for the user's own account and own key.

---

## Prerequisites

1. The user has an Alliance account (username looks like `baidu`).
2. **Public key uploaded to CCDB**: <https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/ssh_authorized_keys> (Manage SSH
   Keys). After upload, **propagation to login nodes takes ~10–30 min** — failing right after upload
   is normal.
3. **Duo enrollment** complete (phone bound in CCDB / MFA settings).
4. The local private key file is located (may be on USB, Downloads, an old-machine export).

Placeholders below: `HOST=fir.alliancecan.ca` · `USER=<username>` · `KEY=<private-key file, e.g. ccdb>`.

---

## Identify the key format

Read **only the first line** — never print the whole private key:

```bash
for f in /path/to/keys/*; do printf '=== %s ===\n' "$f"; head -n 1 "$f"; done
```

| First line | Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` | OpenSSH (new) | ✅ use directly |
| `-----BEGIN RSA/EC/DSA PRIVATE KEY-----` | PEM (old) | ✅ usable (optionally convert) |
| `-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----` / `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` | PKCS#8 | ✅ usable |
| `PuTTY-User-Key-File-2/3` | PuTTY (Windows) | ⚠️ convert with `puttygen` |
| `---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----` | SSH2/RFC4716 **public** key | ⚠️ convert to one-line OpenSSH |
| `ssh-ed25519 AAAA...` / `ssh-rsa AAAA...` | OpenSSH **public** key | ✅ this is what CCDB wants |

Helpers:

```bash
file /path/to/KEY                 # rough type
ssh-keygen -lf /path/to/KEY       # fingerprint / bit length (prompts if encrypted)
cat -A /path/to/KEY | head -2     # check for Windows CRLF ^M$ (breaks parsing)
```

**CRLF gotcha:** a key copied from Windows with `\r\n` may fail to parse. Fix:
`sed -i 's/\r$//' KEY` or `dos2unix KEY`.

---

## Normalize / convert the key

Goal: a usable OpenSSH **private** key + a one-line OpenSSH **public** key.

```bash
# PuTTY .ppk -> OpenSSH (needs putty-tools: apt install putty-tools | brew install putty)
puttygen KEY.ppk -O private-openssh -o KEY
puttygen KEY.ppk -O public-openssh  -o KEY.pub

# SSH2/RFC4716 public key -> one-line OpenSSH public key (no passphrase needed)
ssh-keygen -i -f KEY_ssh2.pub > KEY.pub

# Derive public key from private key (prompts for passphrase -> usually have the user do it, Mode A)
ssh-keygen -y -f KEY > KEY.pub

# Show the public key so the user can verify / upload to CCDB
cat KEY.pub
```

If the CCDB public key and the local private key are **not a pair**, you'll keep getting
`Permission denied`. Confirm with `ssh-keygen -lf KEY` vs `ssh-keygen -lf KEY.pub` (fingerprints match).

---

## Place into `~/.ssh` and set permissions

OpenSSH refuses keys with loose permissions.

```bash
# Linux / macOS
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
cp /path/to/KEY ~/.ssh/KEY && cp /path/to/KEY.pub ~/.ssh/KEY.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/KEY        # private key: owner rw only
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/KEY.pub
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell, built-in OpenSSH)
$ssh = "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $ssh | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\KEY "$ssh\KEY"; Copy-Item .\KEY.pub "$ssh\KEY.pub"
icacls "$ssh\KEY" /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R,W)"
```

---

## Write `~/.ssh/config`

The `onboard` skill writes the full hostname form below. ControlMaster is **essential** (not
optional) for passwordless reuse on Fir, since Duo is required on every fresh login.

```sshconfig
Host fir.alliancecan.ca
    User <username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<KEY>
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    # connection reuse (Linux/macOS): log in once, then no more passphrase/Duo
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 8h
```

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

You may also add a short `Host fir` alias (same options, `HostName fir.alliancecan.ca`) for
convenience. **Windows note:** multiplexing may be unavailable or unreliable. If `ssh -O check`
reports `No ControlPath specified`, `Not a socket`, or another socket error, bypass it with
`-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none` and use the bundled askpass fallback below. Every new
connection otherwise re-triggers Duo, so batch related commands.

---

## First login: Mode A vs Mode B

### Mode A — the user logs in (safe fallback; Codex default)

The user runs the login in **their own interactive terminal**; passphrase and Duo never pass
through the agent.

- **Claude Code**: have the user run it with the `!` prefix so it runs in their own session:
  ```
  ! ssh fir.alliancecan.ca "hostname -f && whoami"
  ```
- **Codex CLI / others**: the sandbox is unsuited to a tty login. Have the user open a **separate
  system terminal** and run `ssh fir.alliancecan.ca`.

User actions: enter passphrase → at the Duo menu pick `1` (Duo Push) → approve on phone. A shell
prompt (or the printed `hostname`/`whoami`) means success. With ControlMaster this is a **one-time**
step; afterward the agent reuses the socket (see next section).

### Mode B — agent-driven login (DRA-config default for the Claude `connect` flow)

Use the installed `connect` skill's `scripts/warm-socket.sh` on Unix hosts with
`timeout` available. Tell the user a Duo push is coming first. The helper selects
the Duo option but returns an empty response for password/passphrase prompts;
it cannot unlock an encrypted key. Only the user approves Duo on their device.

If the key is locked or the helper fails, stop automatic retries and use Mode A.
Never embed a passphrase in an askpass script. Verify the master socket and a
remote command before reporting success.

### Windows / Codex — select Duo Push with the bundled helper

The helper is installed with the `connect` skill. Resolve it through `$CODEX_HOME` when set, or the
user's home directory otherwise. It returns `1` only for recognized Duo menu prompts and returns an
empty response for password, key-passphrase, and unknown prompts. It therefore cannot unlock an
encrypted key that is not already in `ssh-agent`.

```powershell
$codexHome = if ($env:CODEX_HOME) { $env:CODEX_HOME } else { Join-Path $HOME '.codex' }
$askpassPath = Join-Path $codexHome 'skills\connect\scripts\fir-duo-push-askpass.cmd'
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $askpassPath -PathType Leaf)) {
    throw "SSH askpass helper not found: $askpassPath"
}
$env:SSH_ASKPASS = $askpassPath
$env:SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE = 'force'
$env:DISPLAY = 'codex'
ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none fir.alliancecan.ca "hostname -f && whoami && sinfo --version 2>&1"
```

Tell the user before running the command: automation selects **Duo Push**, but only the user can
approve it on their device. Never request a Duo passcode in chat. Batch follow-up work into a
single SSH connection because each independent Windows connection can send a new push.

---

## Verify & reuse the connection

```bash
ssh -O check fir.alliancecan.ca                 # master status: "Master running (pid=...)"
ssh fir.alliancecan.ca 'hostname; whoami'       # reuse, no re-auth
ssh fir.alliancecan.ca 'diskusage_report'       # quota / storage
ssh -O exit fir.alliancecan.ca                  # tear down the multiplexed connection
```

On Windows without working multiplexing, use the askpass command above for verification and retain
the stale-socket bypass flags. A successful response containing the Fir hostname, Alliance username,
and Slurm version verifies the complete path.

When `ControlPersist` expires (8h here) the socket closes automatically; the user logs in again per
Mode A to re-warm it. On Windows, the agent may initiate the askpass connection after warning the
user, but **the user must approve the push; the agent cannot complete Duo itself.**

---

## Security checklist

- [ ] Passphrases remain in the user’s terminal or SSH agent, never in chat or helper files.
- [ ] `~/.ssh` perms: dir `700`, private key `600`, `config` `600`.
- [ ] Never write private-key contents into any log, chat, or repository.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `Permission denied (publickey)` **before any Duo prompt** | Real key problem: not uploaded to CCDB, not yet propagated (~30 min), local/CCDB keys not a pair (compare fingerprints), or wrong key (`ssh -v` shows which was tried). |
| `partial success` → `Permission denied (keyboard-interactive)` | **Normal** — key worked, Duo (factor 2) is required. Not a bug. The agent can't satisfy this; user must log in (Mode A). |
| `ssh_askpass: exec(...): No such file` | Agent has no tty/askpass. Use Mode A, or `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` (Mode B). |
| `Permissions 0644 for 'KEY' are too open` | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/KEY` (Windows: `icacls`). |
| `incorrect passphrase supplied` | Wrong passphrase, or CRLF-corrupted key (`cat -A`, fix with `dos2unix`). |
| Duo never arrives / times out | Check Duo app network; re-select `1` to resend; confirm MFA enrollment in CCDB. |
| `WARNING: connection is not using a post-quantum key exchange` | Harmless, ignore. |
| `REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED` | Host key changed. If expected: `ssh-keygen -R fir.alliancecan.ca`, reconnect. |
| Repeated Duo prompts on Windows | Multiplexing is unavailable or unreliable — use askpass, batch commands into one connection, and expect each independent connection to send a new push. |
